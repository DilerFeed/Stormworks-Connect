## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a way to hack license data that allows you to get the PRO version out of nowhere and activate it on several devices simultaneously, or something similar, but no less dangerous, then send a message to the creator of the program using [the PRO version support site](https://dilerfeed.github.io/Stormworks-Connect/SC_PRO.html).
