# Stormworks-Connect
>A multifunctional application for the Stormworks game, allowing the player to exchange data with the real world directly from the game.

At the moment, the application has just been born, so it supports only one possibility - transferring any image from your PC to any monitor in the game (with the ability to fill) in a matter of seconds.

#

## 1. Image from your computer to any monitor in the game
Simply select the monitor size you currently want to transfer the image to, check the "fill" box if necessary and upload your image. After pressing the signal button to load the image onto the monitor into the controller, it will receive this image and display it on the monitor. Rendering is performed by batch requests that transfer the image in vertical lines in parts.
You need this controller to get the image in the game - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3256896125

# Use GitHub releases to download

I understand that questions may arise regarding why I did not leave the code for the program that you are downloading here. Well, the thing is that I want to develop this program further and for now I don’t want to reveal the principle of its operation, although I am sure that people who understand at least a little about programming will already understand it from the lua code of the controller.
